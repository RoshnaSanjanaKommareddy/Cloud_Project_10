# Cloud_Project_10
## Introduction
This project aims to explore and analyze the neural mechanisms of visual processing by leveraging the [Allen Brain Observatory - Visual Coding AWS Public Data Set](https://registry.opendata.aws/allen-brain-observatory/). Our objective is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how the mouse visual cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus respond to visual stimuli. By applying advanced machine learning techniques on this rich dataset, we aspire to contribute to the broader field of neurobiology, specifically in neuroimaging and electrophysiology. This endeavor aligns with our educational goals of integrating cloud computing and data engineering concepts, particularly within the life sciences domain.
## Technologies Used
- **AWS Services**: Utilizing various AWS services including Amazon S3 for data storage and retrieval, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon EC2 for scalable compute capacity.
- **Programming Languages**: Python for data processing and analysis, leveraging libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing and training machine learning models.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful data visualizations.
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management, with GitHub as the code hosting platform.
## Dataset
We are utilizing the [Allen Brain Observatory - Visual Coding AWS Public Data Set](https://registry.opendata.aws/allen-brain-observatory/), managed by the Allen Institute. This comprehensive dataset encompasses physiological activity across the mouse visual cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, incorporating data from two-photon imaging and Neuropixels probes. It is invaluable for research into visual information processing in the brain.
