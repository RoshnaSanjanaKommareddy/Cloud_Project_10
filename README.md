# Cloud_Project_10
## Introduction
This project aims to explore and analyze the neural mechanisms of visual processing by leveraging the [Allen Brain Observatory - Visual Coding AWS Public Data Set](https://registry.opendata.aws/allen-brain-observatory/). Our objective is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how the mouse visual cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus respond to visual stimuli. By applying advanced machine learning techniques on this rich dataset, we aspire to contribute to the broader field of neurobiology, specifically in neuroimaging and electrophysiology. This endeavor aligns with our educational goals of integrating cloud computing and data engineering concepts, particularly within the life sciences domain.
