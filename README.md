## Introduction
Based on the  [Allen Brain Observatory - Visual Coding AWS Public Data Set](https://registry.opendata.aws/allen-brain-observatory/). The goal of this project is to study and discover how the brain processes visual information. To fully understand how the visual cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of the mouse react to visual input is our main goal. In order to make a contribution to the field of neuroscience, especially in neuroimaging and electrophysiology, we plan to use advanced machine learning techniques on this large dataset. Connecting cloud computing and data engineering ideas in the life sciences is one of our teaching goals, and this project fits in with that.
## Technologies Used
- **AWS Services**: Using a number of AWS services, such as Amazon S3 to store and retrieve data, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon EC2 for flexible computing power.
- **Programming Languages: Python is used to work with tools like NumPy and Pandas to process and analyze data.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch are two machine learning frameworks that can be used to build and train machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn are two data visualization tools that can be used to make smart data visualizations.
- **Version Control: Git is used to handle source code, and GitHub is used to host the code.
## Dataset
The Allen Institute manages the [Allen Brain Observatory - Visual Coding AWS Public Data Set](https://registry.opendata.aws/allen-brain-observatory/), that we are using. Two-photon imaging and Neuropixels probes were used to collect data on physiological activity in the visual cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of the mouse. Research into how the brain processes visual information is aided by it in endless ways.

## Setup and Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository directory]
1.Install Required Libraries:

     pip install -r requirements.txt  
2.AWS Configuration:
Set up your AWS credentials for accessing the dataset.

    aws configure
3.Data Retrieval:
Access the dataset from the AWS S3 bucket.

    aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://allen-brain-observatory/
Set up the environment, add any dependencies that are needed, and get to the dataset from AWS using this section's step-by-step instructions.
## Usage
To use this project for data analysis and visualization:

1. **Run the Analysis Script**:
   Navigate to the script directory and execute the main script.
   ```bash
   cd src
   python main.py
1.Data Visualization:
Visualize the results using the given notebooks.

    jupyter notebook visualization.ipynb
2.Model Training:
Train the machine learning model with the processed data.

    python train_model.py
For further tasks, follow the steps in each script.

There are clear steps in this section on how to use the programs and tools in your project for machine learning, data analysis, and visualization.
