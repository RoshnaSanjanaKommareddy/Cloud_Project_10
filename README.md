## Introduction

This project is based on the Allen Brain Observatory - Visual Coding AWS Public Data Set. Our primary objective is to explore how the brain, specifically the visual cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of mice, processes visual information. We aim to contribute significantly to neuroscience, particularly in neuroimaging and electrophysiology, by employing advanced machine learning techniques on this extensive dataset. This project is a critical intersection of cloud computing, data engineering, and life sciences, aligning with our teaching goals.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Services**: Utilization of Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Amazon EC2.
- **Programming Languages**: Python with libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
